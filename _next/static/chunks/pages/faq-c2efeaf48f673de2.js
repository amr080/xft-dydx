Further, ZK-Rollups allow user balance data on Layer 2 to be available on Layer 1. Scalability benefits in rollups come from moving the expensive computational work off-chain, and only verifying the proof attesting to the validity of the state transition on-chain. ZK-Rollups offer high throughput, instant finality (no risk of trade rollbacks), self-custody, and privacy for your trading strategy. Therefore, they are well suited to the high-value exchange use case.

Eventually, phase 2 will come along, bringing eth2 sharded chains with native computations, which give us ~1,000-5,000 TPS.” While Ethereum 2.0 will theoretically boost network speeds to 100,000 TPS, base layer scaling is still a while away.

In case that the request is not served within a limited time frame, the user is able to freeze the StarkEx contract (and thus the exchange) and withdraw directly from the frozen contract. There are two forced actions: forcedWithdrawal andforcedTrade. When a forcedWithdrawal request is submitted, the StarkEx Contract either withdraws funds for you, or proves that the request is illegitimate (e.g. a user requests to withdraw more money than their off-chain position.) If StarkEx fails to withdraw funds within a limited timeframe, a user can call to the freeze function - effectively preventing the StarkEx contract from changing its state, and enabling an “escape mode”, in which users can exit with USDC based on the total value of their position in the last accepted on-chain batch. When a forcedTrade request is submitted, two users trade between them a certain amount of some synthetic against another amount of collateral, to submit these amounts on-chain. Either the system performs the trade (or proves its invalidity), or the users get the ability to freeze the on-chain StarkEx Contract, and retrieve their funds."}},{type:"Question",name:"What happens if I lose my Stark Key?",acceptedAnswer:{type:"Answer",text:"If you lose your Stark Key, you can’t perform any trades, transfer, or withdrawal on Layer 2 until you regenerate a new one using your wallet, since these actions are all protected by signing with your Stark Key. However, you can still submit the relevant forcedWithdrawal and forcedTrade requests on-chain, using your Ethereum key. The recommended flow is to make forced trade requests with users in order to close your position, then withdraw all your collateral with forced withdrawal. Alternatively, if you wish to remain on Layer 2, you can register a newly generated, public Stark Key to the system, retrieve apositionId from dYdX, and perform forcedTrade transactions on Layer 1 between your old and new positions (while maintaining the same collateralization ratios)."}},{type:"Question",name:"How does the insurance fund work?",acceptedAnswer:{type:"Answer",text:"The insurance fund will not be decentralized at launch, and the dYdX team will be directly responsible for deposits & withdrawals to and from the fund. In the future, we may decentralize some aspects of the fund; however, initially, our priority is to ensure that underwater accounts are dealt with in a timely manner."}},{type:"Question",name:"Are the new smart contracts audited?",acceptedAnswer:{type:"Answer",text:"We take the security of our smart contracts extremely seriously. We’ve conducted rigorous internal testing and contracted independent top security firm PeckShield to perform a thorough audit of our smart contracts. Our audit will be open-source, and verifiable by anyone. Further, our track record speaks for itself: since launching our first product in October of 2018, dYdX is one of the only major DeFi protocols that has yet to receive a bug report of user funds being at-risk. No users have ever lost funds on dYdX."}},{type:"Question",name:"What is dYdX's business model?",acceptedAnswer:{type:"Answer",text:"dYdX has been building a business model around the exchange. We introduced maker taker trading fees in March 2020. Our goals have been to earn consistent revenue as a company, and to incentivize traders to provide more liquidity to our protocol."}},{type:"Question",name:"What's next for the platform?",acceptedAnswer:{type:"Answer",text:"After our Layer 2 launch, we will focus on decentralizing more parts of our technology stack and handing over more control to our users. This will be a gradual process that could ultimately result in a DAO to govern the community. We are taking a careful look at different design tradeoffs."}},{type:"Question",name:"Will dYdX continue to support Spot & Margin trading?",acceptedAnswer:{type:"Answer",text:"Perpetuals will be the focus for dYdX given the strong market interest from both retail and institutional users in DeFi. Perpetuals offer cost-efficient trading with leverage, and dYdX’s model allows it to offer a seamless trading experience across many perpetuals. dYdX will continue to support Spot and Margin trading, but these products may also be phased out."}},{type:"Question",name:"What is the future of decentralized exchange?",acceptedAnswer:{type:"Answer",text:"While DEXs have become increasingly popular for spot products, we expect DEXs to become just as popular for margin and perpetual markets in the coming years. This is largely due to the fact that decentralized margin and perpetuals are newer and take time for users to adopt. Further, we think DEXs will continue to gain market share in relation to centralized exchanges, due to lower frictions to onboard, better UI/UX, increased security guarantees, and more attractive products to trade. dYdX combines the security and transparency of a DEX, with the speed and usability of a CEX. We think DeFi will supersede traditional finance technology only if the user experience & design are exceptional."}}]})}}),v(i.Z,null,v(y.X6,null,t({key:"FAQS"})),v(y.pm,null,t({key:"FAQS_SUBTITLE"})),v(k,null,v(S,null,v(x,null,v(T,null,v(f,null)))))))})},8192:function(e,t,a){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/faq",function(){return a(5346)}])}},function(e){e.O(0,[681,61,888,774,179],function(){return e(e.s=8192)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
